i disagree with this because this is regarding testsymtable.c, which i

What warnings does critTer generate on symtablelist.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

symtablelist.c: line 74: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvValue' through an assert?

symtablelist.c: line 110: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvValue' through an assert?

symtablelist.c: line 207: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvExtra' through an assert?

pvValue and pvExtra can be null, so asserting here would make it
non-functional. Lecture 13, slide 27 for pvValue, and
precept with Prof. Gabai explained that pvExtra can be null. p

What warnings does splint generate on symtablehash.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
