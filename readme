"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and
any source that you have used but not listed in the authorized sources
should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

Tedious, but reinforced my understanding of linked lists and hash table
implemented linked lists. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on symtablelist.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on symtablelist.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

symtablelist.c: line 74: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvValue' through an assert?

symtablelist.c: line 110: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvValue' through an assert?

symtablelist.c: line 207: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvExtra' through an assert?

pvValue and pvExtra can be null, so asserting here would make it
non-functional. Lecture 13, slide 27 for pvValue, and
precept with Prof. Gabai explained that pvExtra can be null.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on symtablehash.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on symtablehash.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

symtablehash.c: line 123: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvValue' through an assert?

symtablehash.c: line 170: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvValue' through an assert?

symtablehash.c: line 283: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvExtra' through an assert?

pvValue and pvExtra can be null, so asserting here would make it
non-functional. Lecture 13, slide 27 for pvValue, and
precept with Prof. Gabai explained that pvExtra can be null.

What are the CPU times reported by testsymtable.c with binding counts
50, 500, 5000, 50000, and 500000 using (1) your linked list
implementation, (2) your non-expanding hash table implementation, and
(3) your expanding hash table implementation? Fill in the blanks.

The linked list implementation with:
-- 50 bindings consumed 0.000000 seconds.
-- 500 bindings consumed 0.003370 seconds.
-- 5000 bindings consumed 1.082850 seconds.
-- 50000 bindings consumed 109.774720 seconds.
-- 500000 bindings consumed More than 5 minutes. 

The non-expanding hash table implementation with:
-- 50 bindings consumed 0.000000 seconds.
-- 500 bindings consumed 0.000000 seconds.
-- 5000 bindings consumed 0.004946 seconds.
-- 50000 bindings consumed 0.416723 seconds.
-- 500000 bindings consumed 83.661981 seconds.

The expanding hash table implementation with:
-- 50 bindings consumed 0.000000 seconds.
-- 500 bindings consumed 0.000000 seconds.
-- 5000 bindings consumed 0.005826 seconds.
-- 50000 bindings consumed 0.132349 seconds.
-- 500000 bindings consumed 1.857416 seconds.
